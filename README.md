Objective:

Use aiohttp to asynchronously fetch data from PokeAPI, then use the retrieved data to simulate a battle between Pokémon based on their statistics.

Tasks:

Select Pokémon: Each student should choose 10 Pokémon to work with. Information for each Pokémon can be retrieved from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}.
Create an Asynchronous Script:
Write an asynchronous Python script that makes parallel requests to PokeAPI, retrieves data about each Pokémon.
Use the data retrieved to determine a Pokémon's "strength" based on their statistics, such as the sum of attack, defense, and speed stats.
Model a Battle:
Develop a simple logic to simulate a battle between two randomly chosen Pokémon from the list. Determine the winner based on "strength".
Output the results of the battle, including the statistics of each Pokémon and the outcome of the fight.
